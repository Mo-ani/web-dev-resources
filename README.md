# Web Development Learning Resources

The following links are useful (beginner-friendly) learning resources, mainly for HTML, CSS and
vanilla Javascript (for the web), which I have collated and categorised. Most of them were originally shared with me by members of the FAC community.

### General
- [CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/)- website which quickly shows browser compatibility for different features
- GitHub repo of free online programming books- [link](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)


### Javascript
- Javascript- Understanding the weird parts, first 3.5 hours for free ([youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts))
- Wes Bos' [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/)- a 30-video vanilla JS tutorial series.
- [Javascript the Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) by Douglas Crockford- free book in pdf format
